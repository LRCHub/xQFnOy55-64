First time I saw that Girl, I know that she was
Made only for me, girl of my dreams
And there I stood, in front of her,
Imaging how sweet our Love could be
And she smile for me.

So we started meeting and going out
To restaurants and nice romantic bars
One night it happened, I brought her home
She kissed me and she said we're lovers now.

It was a feeling just like flying to the stars
Or just like driving a new car

I wonder why she's gone away
I wonder why she's gone away

It was like heaven, so wonderful
My girlfriend, she did everything for me
She washed the dishes, cleaned up the floor
Bought beer for me and so many things more

We were the perfect couple could see
I know she was only made for me.

I wonder why she's gone away
I wonder why she's gone away
I wonder why she's gone away
I wonder why she's gone away
