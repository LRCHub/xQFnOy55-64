I'm sitting in my room
I'm looking through the window
I see raindrops falling down
and I can hear the wind blow
I wonder where you are
I wonder what you do
I won't make it on my own
I need to be with you
And I wonder
Was our love not strong enough
To keep us going on
Tell me what I did wrong
Was our love not strong enough
To make you fall
like i've fallen for you
Days are passing by
It seems I can't forget you
The teardrops in my eyes
Are showing that I miss you
I wonder where you are
I wonder what you do
I won't make it on my own
I need to be with you
