[00:34.75] Friday night
[00:39.24] And I don't have a clue
[00:42.47] Just in the crowds
[00:48.37] We're dreaming as we move
[01:00.87] 
[00:57.44] I wonder who we are
[01:02.05] I wonder who we are tonight
[01:15.55] 
[01:32.03] And I know that someone's following me
[01:39.37] My littered face on the street
[01:47.46] The loveliest season has taken you
[01:57.46] Write my name in the leaves
[02:10.96] 
[02:28.53] I wonder who we are
[02:37.65] I wonder who we are tonight
