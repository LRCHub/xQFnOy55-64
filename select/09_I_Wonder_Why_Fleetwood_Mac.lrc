[00:18.82] It's hard
[00:21.43] When a love goes wrong
[00:26.73] Picking up the pieces to go on
[00:32.98] Our dreams
[00:35.95] Are scattered in the wind
[00:41.19] I won't let it take me under
[00:44.54] Even though you tried... and...
[01:00.04] 
[00:48.39] I wonder why
[00:52.97] Things go the way they do
[00:56.38] Why people lie, and break a heart in two
[01:03.58] I wonder why
[01:07.20] Things go the way they do
[01:19.70] 
[01:16.03] It's strange
[01:19.37] Strange the way I feel
[01:24.46] Time is all I need to make me heal
[01:30.76] You're gone
[01:33.51] And now I'm all alone (now you're all alone)
[01:39.54] I'll reclaim the thunder
[01:42.62] Dry the tears I'be cried... still...
[02:00.62] 
[01:45.97] I wonder why
[01:50.71] Things go the way they do
[01:54.15] Why people lie, and break a heart in two
[02:01.48] I wonder why
[02:05.23] Things go the way they do
[02:17.73] 
[02:10.49] Now I'm turning my back on confusion
[02:17.65] I won't live in a world of illusion
[02:24.97] Well the river stopped running through me
[02:29.51] You did'nt see what you did to me
[02:33.48] I've got to try to find, some kind of peace of mind
[02:37.07] You're just a mystery to me
[02:50.57] 
[02:56.49] I'll reclaim the thunder
[02:58.71] Dry the tears I've cried... still...
[03:16.71] 
[03:02.20] I wonder why
[03:07.02] Things go the way they do
[03:10.59] Why people lie, and break a heart in two
[03:17.86] I wonder why
[03:21.62] Things go the way they do
