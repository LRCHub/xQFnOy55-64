I wonder if there'll come a time
When your hand won't fit in mine
And you'll know in your mind
It's time

We've got to live
We've got to live
Before we're old and sad
I want to live
So bad

I wonder why it never seems to work
And I try but it knocks me to the ground
It brings me down
It brings me down

We've got to live
We've got to live
Before we're old and sad
I want to live
So bad

I wonder if the sorry flame still burns
Just blacks your heart
Or will you leave not to return
Not to return

We've got to live
We've got to live
Before we're old and sad
I want to live
So bad
